## Task list (GFM-style)

## Code fences

function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

```bash
# Fenced shell block
wrangler pages dev public --port 8787
```

## Links, URLs, images
- Standard link: [Example](https://example.com)
- Bare URL should auto-link (linkify): https://www.cloudflare.com
- Inline image: ![Placeholder image](https://dummyimage.com/600x240/111827/e2e8f0&text=Markdown+Image+Test)
- Inline image with title: ![With title](https://dummyimage.com/480x200/0f172a/e2e8f0&text=With+Title "Image title text")
- Reference image: ![Reference][ref-img]
- Relative image (expected to 404 unless the file exists): ![Local test](images/sample.png)

## Table
| Syntax | Description | Should render? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `table` | Built-in markdown-it table support | Yes |
| `~~strike~~` | Strikethrough text | Yes |
| `[ ]` tasks | GFM checkbox styling | Plain list items (no checkboxes) |

## Horizontal rule
---

## Definition list (GFM-style, needs plugin)
Term
: Definition content that likely renders as plain paragraphs.

Another term
: Another description

## Footnote (needs plugin)
This line references a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: Footnote details. Without the footnote plugin this shows as literal text.

## Subscript and superscript (needs plugin)
H~2~O and 2^3^ should appear as literal text without sub/superscript styling.

## Raw HTML
<mark>Inline mark tag should render as highlighted text.</mark>
